## Major New Features


### Email Confirmation System

- Upon creating a new account via the `register` command, an automatic email is sent to the user.
- The email contains a unique verification code required to confirm the registration.
- This ensures that the email address is valid and adds a security layer to the user registration process.

### Command Rating System

- Clients can **rate individual orders** via the new command: `client assess`.
- Cooks can **view their ratings** using: `cook stats`.
- Ratings are **visible to clients** at the time of placing a new order.
- This introduces a **reputation layer** for cooks and helps guide future decisions.

## Technical Fixes

- `verifycommands`: Logic has been revised and corrected.
- `cook commands`: Updated to reflect proper role logic and access controls.

## Notes

- The rating system represents a significant extension to the platform.
